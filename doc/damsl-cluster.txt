We have 33 machines available for experiments at JHU, in the following topology:

-- damsl.cs.jhu.edu : gateway and file server, with directories (available when cd'ed into on all cluster nodes below):
 | \++ /damsl/software: please install any software that is not available via a package manager here.
 | \++ /damsl/projects/: please let Yanif know your data storage needs. We can create you a project directory under here.

To access these, first log in to damsel, and then the desired cluster node, e.g.:

yna@tempest> ssh yna@damsl.cs.jhu.edu
yna@damsel> ssh yna@qp5

Important: when you log into damsl.cs.jhu.edu your home directory is by default at: /home/<username>
This is *not* your network home drive, instead your network home is located at: /damsl/homes/<username>
(your network home is available on all nodes).
